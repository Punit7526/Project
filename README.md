# Data Analytics Projects: Automobile & Movie Dataset Analysis

This repository contains two beginner-friendly data analytics projects using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Each project demonstrates how to clean, analyze, and visualize real-world datasets using popular Python libraries.

## üìÅ Projects Included

### 1. Automobile Dataset Analysis (`autoblie_project.ipynb`)

In this project, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an automobile dataset. Key tasks include:

- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Data type conversion
- Exploratory data analysis (mean, median, correlation, etc.)
- Visualizations (box plots, scatter plots, regression plots)
- Regression modeling to explore relationships between variables

### 2. Movie Dataset Analysis (`movie_project.ipynb`)

This project analyzes a movie dataset with the goal of extracting insights about movie performance. Tasks covered:

- Dataset overview and cleanup
- Analysis of genres, ratings, and revenues
- Visualization of trends (e.g., budget vs. revenue, ratings over time)
- Correlation analysis and filtering data based on conditions

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
